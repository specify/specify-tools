Synonymizing a taxon entry with another term has the effect of keeping both names visible in the tree but making one term preferable for use over the synonymized term. This action is useful for maintaining the visibility of an obsolete or unused name, while indicating a preferred name for that taxon.\n\nPerforming this action will synonymize '%s' to '%s' and make '%s' the preferred name. Taxa cannot be synonymized if they have child nodes present. Synonyms appear in blue characters; mouse-over pop-up windows on '%s' and '%s' show the synonymic relationship.\n\nCollection Object records which have determinations linked to '%s' before the synonymization will be linked to '%s' via the Preferred Taxon field after this action.\n\nNote that Synonymize and Merge actions in the taxon tree have different impacts on your data. Synonymization leaves the synonymized term visible and searchable in your Taxon Tree. Merging taxa, e.g. two genera or two species, removes the merged taxon from the tree and transfers all children to the preferred Taxon. Both operations, when done at the rank of genus or below, overwrite the current Determination record for any linked Collection Objects. 
Moving entries in the Taxon tree changes their parent. Move actions do not create synonymies, they simply move a taxon from one parent to another.  The move action is must useful for correcting mistakes in taxon placement in the tree, or for re-arranging taxon entries based on preferred higher-level classification preferences.\n\nIn this case '%s' will be attached to a new parent '%s'. Note that Moves occurr between entries at two different ranks, for example moving a family from ond order to another. At the rank of species and below, a Move action will make a new name comvination (e.g. "Genus1 species1" becomes "Genus2 species1") which may not be nomenclaturally valid and may require subsequent editing to correspond to actual published nomenclature.\n\nNote: for any Collection Object records determined to species or lower rank, the Move action will overwrite the existing Taxon and Preferred Taxon data field contents with the new name combination for all Determinations linked to the moved taxon name. 
A Merge operation in the Taxon Tree is useful for correcting spelling errors or for removing unwanted duplicate variant spellings for an entry. A typical use would be to remove a variant spelling of a taxon name and to consolidate any taxa which may be under it, to another preferred spelling of that taxon.  Merging taxa at the level of Genus and below changes the taxonomic determinations of linked Collection Object Records. Merging genera or lower level taxa should be done with extreme caution.\n\nPerforming this action will merge '%s' and its children into '%s'. It will also take all of the child nodes under '%s' and make them children under '%s' in one of two ways. If nodes under '%s' are matched by identically-named nodes under '%s', those matching nodes will be merged under '%s'. If there no matching identically-named child nodes under '%s' then child nodes of '%s' will simply be moved under '%s'.\n\nIf there are grandchildren nodes under any of the children nodes of '%s', they will also be moved. If they match identically-named grandchildren at the same rank under '%s' they will be merged with those corresponding nodes at that rank, and so on, all the way down the tree.\n\nA Merge action will update the linkages to your Collection Object records to reflect the preferred %s' entry and its children. '%s' will be removed from this tree by this action after all of its children have been merged or moved under '%s'.\n\nNote: for any Collection Object records determined to species or lower rank, a Merge action at the level of genus will create new genus-species combinations and overwrite the existing Taxon and Preferred Taxon data field contents with the new name combination for all Determinations liked to the moved taxon name. New name combinations generated by a Merge operation may not be nomenclaturally valid and may require subsequent editing to correspond to actual published nomenclature. 
Synonymizing a term in the Geography tree with another term has the effect of keeping both names visible in the tree but making one term preferable for use over the synonymized term.  This action is useful for maintaining the visibility or historical record of a geographic place name, while indicating a preferred (perhaps more modern) name for that place.\n\nPerforming this action will synonymize '%s' to '%s' and make '%s' the preferred name. Geographical entries cannot be synonymized if they have child nodes present.
Moving a geography entry changes the parent of that node in the tree. This is useful for correcting misplacements of geographical terms, or perhaps for resolving the placement in the tree of originally ambiguous or unknown geographical terms when new information has become available. Move operations are only enabled when moving an entry to a new parent node at a higher level in the tree.\n\nIn this case, '%s' will become a child under the entry '%s'. Any entries under '%s' will also be relocated. '%s' will still be associated with Collection Object records which refer to it, but geography terms in the tree above this level will change for those Collection Objects reflecting the new parentage of '%s'.
A Merge operation in the Geography tree is useful for correcting spelling errors or for removing unwanted duplicate variant spellings for an entry. A typical use would be to remove a variant spelling of a country name and to consolidate any state or province entries, which may be under it, to another preferred spelling of that country.\n\nPerforming this action will merge '%s' and its children into '%s'. It will also take all of the child nodes under '%s' and make them children under '%s' in one of two ways. If nodes under '%s' are matched by identically-named nodes under '%s', those matching nodes will be merged under '%s'. If there no matching identically-named child nodes under '%s' then child nodes of '%s' will simply be moved under '%s'.\n\nIf there are grandchildren nodes under any of the children nodes of '%s', they will also be moved. If they match identically-named grandchildren at the same rank under '%s' they will be merged with those corresponding nodes at that rank, and so on, all the way down the tree. A Merge action will update the linkages to your Collection Object records to reflect the preferred '%s' entry and its children. '%s' will be removed from this tree by this action after all of its children have merged or moved under '%s'.
Moving a chronostratigraphic interval changes the parent of that interval in the tree. This is useful for correcting misplacements or for resolving the interval placement in the tree of originally ambiguous terms. Move operations are only enabled when moving an interval to a new parent node at a higher level in the tree.\n\nIn this case, '%s' will become a child under the interval '%s'. Any entries under '%s' will also be relocated. '%s' will still be associated with Collection Object records which refer to it, but chronostratigraphic terms in the tree above this level will change for those Collection Objects reflecting the new parentage of '%s'.
A Merge operation in the chronostratigraphic tree is useful for correcting spelling errors or for removing unwanted duplicate variant spellings for an entry. A typical use would be to remove a variant spelling of a time interval and to consolidate any entries which may be under it, to another preferred spelling of that interval.\n\nPerforming this action will merge '%s' and its children into '%s'. It will also take all of the child nodes under '%s' and make them children under '%s' in one of two ways. If nodes under '%s' are matched by identically-named nodes under '%s', those matching nodes will be merged under '%s'. If there are no matching identically-named child nodes under '%s' then child nodes of '%s' will simply be moved under '%s'.\n\nIf there are grandchildren nodes under any of the children nodes of '%s', they will also be moved. If they match identically-named grandchildren at the same rank under '%s' they will be merged with those corresponding nodes at that rank, and so on, all they way down the tree.\n\nA Merge action will update the linkages to your Collection Object records to reflect the preferred '%s' entry and its children. '%s' will be removed from this tree by this action after all of its children have been merged or moved under '%s'.
Moving a lithostratigraphic stratum changes its parent in the tree. This is useful for correcting misplacements or for resolving the stratum placement in the tree of originally ambiguous terms. Move operations are only enabled when moving a stratum to a new parent node at a higher level in the tree.\n\nIn this case, '%s' will become a child under the stratum '%s'. Any entries under '%s' will also be relocated. '%s' will still be associated with Collection Object records which refer to it, but lithostratigraphic terms in the tree above this level will change for those Collection Objects reflecting the new parentage of '%s'.
A Merge operation in the lithostratigraphic tree is useful for correcting spelling errors or for removing unwanted duplicate variant spellings for a stratum. A typical use would be to remove a variant spelling of a stratum and to consolidate any entries which may be under it, to another preferred spelling of that stratum.\n\nPerforming this action will merge '%s' and its children into '%s'. It will also take all of the child nodes under '%s' and make them children under '%s' in one of two ways. If nodes under '%s' are matched by identically-named nodes under '%s', those matching nodes will be merged under '%s'. If there are no matching identically-named child nodes under '%s' then child nodes of '%s' will simply be moved under '%s'.\n\nIf there are grandchildren nodes under any of the children nodes of '%s', they will also be moved. If they match identically-named grandchildren at the same rank under '%s' they will be merged with those corresponding nodes at that rank, and so on, all they way down the tree.\n\nA Merge action will update the linkages to your Collection Object records to reflect the preferred '%s' entry and its children. '%s' will be removed from this tree by this action after all of its children have been merged or moved under '%s'.
Moving entries in the storage tree changes their parent.  The move action is most useful for correcting mistakes in storage placement.\\nIn this case '%s' will be attached to a new parent '%s'. Note that Moves occur between entries at two different ranks, for example moving a Collection to a different building.\n\nAny Collection Object records linked to a storage location that is moved will be correspondingly updated to reflect the new storage location.
A Merge operation in the Storage Location tree is useful for correcting spelling errors or for removing unwanted duplicate variant spellings for an entry.\n\nPerforming this action will merge '%s' and its children into '%s'. It will also take all of the child nodes under '%s' and make them children under '%s' in one of two ways. If nodes under '%s' are matched by identically-named nodes under '%s', those matching nodes will be merged under '%s'. If there no matching identically-named child nodes under '%s' then child nodes of '%s' will simply be moved under '%s'.\n\nIf there are grandchildren nodes under any of the children nodes of '%s', they will also be moved. If they match identically-named grandchildren at the same rank under '%s' they will be merged with those corresponding nodes at that rank, and so on, all the way down the tree. A Merge action will update the linkages to your Collection Object records to reflect the preferred '%s' entry and its children. '%s' will be removed from this tree by this action after all of its children have merged or moved under '%s'.
