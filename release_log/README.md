# release_log

This app will provide a list of issues from a repository and will give you an ability to filter the results.

The only configuration you need to on the server-side is providing the GitHub username and GitHub token at the beginning of the `release_log/index.php` file. You can generate a GitHub token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). That token does not need to have any permissions.
